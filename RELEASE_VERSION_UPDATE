** Edit this file to release a new chart version, in a scenario where no other change to this project is required.

** An example usage scenario of this is when a version change occurred to any modules in DPS-tools, but no other changes to
helm chart, docker images, or values files are required. To ensure docker images are built with the release version of the DPS-tools module, the release
pipeline of this repo must be run. Without a change to this file or any other files, it will produce the same build number, as the previous release build.

** Why does it happen? Bob script generate-version, which is used to calculate the release version, calculates the new build number from the git history
of VERSION_PREFIX file, how many commits ago it was modified.

** To edit this file include the TORF number of your story. If a change to this file is the only change (as it should be), you can +2 the code review and merge.
